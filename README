parray_new:
  This function allocates a paranoid array with guard pages surrounding each block of memory.
  Each block of memory will be a multiple of 4096 in size, including the guard pages.
  The memory is allocated with posix_memalign with enough space for count + count + 2 pages,
  since there will be a guard page before index 0 and a guard page after the last index,
  then the allocated memory is looped through and guard pages are created with mprotect for every
  other page starting at the first page.

parray_entry:
  This function returns a pointer to the specified index.  To calculate the offset
  we need to skip over (pgsize * (2 + (2*index)) pages.  This will get us to the end of the correct page,
  then subtract size to get the start of the entry.

To get the libparray.so file to work properly I had to add the current working directory to my PATH, the line I used is in the makefile but it needs to be ran on the command line since the Makefile is a separate process from the shell.
